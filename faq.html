                                            can become a Surgeon, General Practitioner (GP), or specialise in a particular medicine area. Before a surgery, your anaesthetist will administer anaesthetics and provide you with the perioperative care you need before, during and after surgery. To become an anaesthetist in Australia, doctors typically complete a 6-year medicine degree, complete 3 years of hospital training as well as a further 5 years of experience.

                                           <strong>Informed financial consent (IFC)</strong> is the provision of cost information to patients, including notification of likely out-of-pocket expenses (gaps), by all relevant service providers, preferably in writing, prior to admission to hospital or treatment.
                                            </br>
                                            </br>
                                            An IFC can be provided to, patients in writing or via suitable to use communication technologies such as email, SMS and apps.

                                            </br>
                                            Occasionally, the course of medical treatment can be uncertain and, because anaesthetic is based on time, it can be difficult for anaesthetists to provide definitive IFC. Due to this, you may receive an estimate, in which case an account will be sent out post operation for payment.

                                            The benefit amount you will expect to receive can vary and is based on your level of cover, your procedure and how long your surgery went for. Generally speaking, between Medicare and your Health fund you could receive up to 30% of the fee paid. If you have been asked to make a co-payment, then this is your out of pocket ‘gap’ fee and is not claimable, the remaining will be submitted on your behalf to Medicare and your Health fund.

                                        Both terms mean the same. Gap cover is when your health fund has an arrangement in place with the medical services provider (e.g. the hospital or your doctor). Gap cover insures you against some of the out-of-pocket costs between what the medical services provider charges you and what Medicare will give you back (the gap payment).
                                        </br>

                                        Therefore, both terms mean the same. A gap payment, also known as an out-of-pocket expense, is the amount outstanding between what a hospital or specialist charges and what the combination of Medicare and your private health insurance fund covers.
